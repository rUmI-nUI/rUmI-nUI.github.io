# Chapter 4: Plurals, Collectives, Parts and Indefinite Quantities

Rúmí has a 4-way distinction of marking non-singular quantities of nouns - plurals, collectives, parts and indefinitives. While these concepts exist in English and toki pona, the oligosynthetic nature of Rúmí allows for all four designations to be identified by prefixes or suffixes. 

## Plurals: N(ö)-

The plural form is used to denote abundance of a quantity and is analogous to "-s" in English and "___ mute" in toki pona. Like its English and toki pona equivalent, it implies a set of *independent* elements. 

Examples:
* a: space, na: spaces
  * Note: the addition of a modifier suffix (-m) to the plural form changes its meaning to "much space/bigger" (*nam*), and is no longer considered a plural noun.

* u: human, nu: people
* gróms: a sweet, nö-gróms: sweets

## Collectives: -(ö)n

Collectives are nouns that denote a *set of interrelated elements*. Like in English, Rúmí collectives are standalone nouns.

* a: space, an: area
* u: human, un: humanity
  * Contrast with "nu" for "people" - "un" implies a network of relations among people.
* ios: plant, iosön: vegetation
* nö: number, nön: numerical set
* úí: word, úín: sentence/phrase
  * Contrast with "núí", words or lexicon. In a sentence, words are related to each other whereas a lexicon is a set of words.
 
## Parts: Z(ö)- or -(ö)z (divisions)

Components of a larger whole are "parts" and are denoted by the prefix form. In contrast, divisions of a whole that retain the whole's characteristics are identified using the suffix form. Independently, "zöm" can be used as a modifier in its own right (Ex: bôs zöm os éc -> The arm is a part of the body)

* a: space, za: compartment, az: partition (spatial)
* á: time, zá: minute/second/hour/day, áz: interval
* u: human, zu: body part, uz: anatomical section
  * Note: In contrast to their umbrella term, all body parts end in "-s" as they are fundamentally "things"

## Indefinitives: Ym(ö)-

The indefinite prefix is used to denote an unspecified/uncertain quantity of something and is equivalent to "some/something" in English. Like above, "ymöm" can be used as a modifier to denote "some" of something (Ex: Se-vte fuöt ymöm jé -> Send me some water). 

* a: space, yma: some space
* u: human, ymu: somebody
* ânawé: stick, ym-ânawé: some stick
