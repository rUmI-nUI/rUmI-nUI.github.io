# Chapter 0: rUmI-nUI's Semantic Structure

rUmI is a language descended from aUI and toki pona. Much like aUI, rUmI's words are such that the spelling immediately reflects the word's meaning - indeed, the core elements of meaning (I) are exactly the same as those in aUI. However, rUmI words are further structured using a system of stems (UIz), with each root corresponding to a nimi from the toki pona lexicon. The relationship between nI and nUIz is as follows:

aUI elements of meaning (nI) -> grouped into word stems (nUIz) which can function as standalone words or -> further grouped into compounds (UI) separated by hyphens (-) -> that can be modified with nI to further refine meaning. 

This system is designed to 1. harness aUI's ability to define specific concepts *ab initio* while also making the most of 2.) toki pona's ability to explain complex topics using few words. The result - rUmI - is intended to offer a unique flexibility in expression that isn't constrained by a limited set of words nor requires the memorization of thousands of hyper-specific terms. 

## Items on the left modify items on the right

This is the cardinal rule of rUmI's semantic organization. Specifically:

1. Within a stem (UIz), elements of meaning (nI) on the left modify those on the right. This means that the fundamental meaning of a stem is the rightmost I. An example from this page:
    * iU: Derived from the elements "light" and "spirit". iU is a concept/spirit (U) of type light/knowledge (i) - together, "information/semantics".

2. Within a word (UI), stems on the left modify those on the right. Just like above, the fundamental meaning of a word is the rightmost UIz. An example from this page:
    * iU-e: Derived from "iU: information/semantics" and "e: movement/flow". Together, "flow of information"

3. Within a sentence, nouns are modified by words to the left. An example from this page:
    * rUmI-nUIm iU-e dU: "way of information flow of rUmI nUI"

## Sentence word order

Sentence structure in rUmI follows 4 principles:

1. Sentences must have an independent clause which, at a minimum, contain a noun/pronoun. Verbs are optional.
2. Any subject (doer of action) that is a human pronoun (i.e. I, you, he/she/they, us, y'all) must be the first word in a simple sentence or within a clause.
3. Modifiers (prepositions, nouns in the genitive, sociative or instrumental cases, conjunctions, etc) precede their targets.
4. Subjects that aren't human pronouns that perform an action with an object (transitive verb) need to be marked in the ergative case.

If the above are satisfied, the remaining words in a sentence can be arranged in any way as seen fit.
