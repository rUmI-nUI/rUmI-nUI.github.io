# Chapter 3: Numbers

Rúmí uses a system of numbers different from those of aUI and toki pona, though the first five nonzero numbers (1,2,3,4,5) are the same as in aUI (â, ê, î, û, ô), with the circumflex representing a nasal sound. The following table explains the Rúmí number system in more detail, using nânakúí-jió only:


|Number|In Rúmí|Notes|
|-------|-------|-|
|1|â|-|
|2|ê|-|
|3|î|-|
|4|û|-|
|5|ô|-|
|6|íbâ| A contraction of "ô íb â"|
|7|íbê| See previous note|
|8|íbî|-|
|9|íbû|-|
|10|ânk| Derived as "one-number-up", indicates the first power of ten and therefore, 10|
|11|ânkâ|A hyphen between ânk and â is not needed|
|12|ânkê|-|
|13|ânkî|-|
|14|ânkû|-|
|15|ânkô|An optional alternative is "în-bô", literally "three hands".<br> A hyphen is recommended as "bô" is a root|
|16|ânkíbâ|-|
|17|ânkíbê|-|
|18|ânkíbî|-|
|19|ânkíbû|-|
|20|ênânk|All multiples of 10 follow the pattern of number + "n" + "ânk". <br> Examples: 30 = înânk, 80 = íbûnânk|
|21-99|ênânkâ - íbûnânkíbû| All integers from 1-99 are treated as independent roots (no hyphens) and follow the same pattern <br> Examples: 42 = ûnânkê, 57: ônânkíbê|
|100|ênk|The first 9 powers of 10 follow the pattern of "number"+"nk" <br> Examples: 1000 = înk, 1,000,000 = íbânk <br> All multiples of powers of 10 are independent roots that follow pattern of "number" + "n" + "power of 10" <br> Examples: 200 = ênênk, 800 = íbînênk|
|101-999|ênk íb â - ênk íb íbûnânkíbû|All numbers > 100 are multi-word phrases that follow the pattern of "power of 10" íb "sub-100 number" <br> Examples: 404 = ûnênk íb û, 756 = íbênênk íb ônânkíbâ|
|1000-10^9|See notes|All integers keep following the above convention, with higher powers of 10 appended to the front of the phrase, followed by íb <br> Examples: 1111 = înk íb ênk íb ânkâ, 945234 = íbûnônk íb ûnûnk íb ônînk íb ênênk íb ínânkû|
|10^9+|See notes|All integers greater than 10^9 are required to be written in scientific notation (see below)|
