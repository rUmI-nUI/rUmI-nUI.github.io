# 3-öm iú-ênas: Nö-nö
# Chapter 3: Numbers

Rúmí uses a system of numbers different from those of aUI and toki pona, though the first five nonzero numbers (1,2,3,4,5) are the same as in aUI (â, ê, î, û, ô), with the circumflex representing a nasal sound. The following table explains the Rúmí number system in more detail, using nânakúí-jió only:


|Number|In Rúmí|Notes|
|-------|-------|-|
|1|â|-|
|2|ê|-|
|3|î|-|
|4|û|-|
|5|ô|-|
|6|íbâ| A contraction of "ô íb â"|
|7|íbê| See previous note|
|8|íbî|-|
|9|íbû|-|
|10|ânk| Derived as "one-number-up", indicates the first power of ten and therefore, 10|
