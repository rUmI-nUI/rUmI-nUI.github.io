# Chapter 3: Numbers

Rúmí uses a system of numbers different from those of aUI and toki pona, though the first five nonzero numbers (1,2,3,4,5) are the same as in aUI (â, ê, î, û, ô), with the circumflex representing a nasal sound. The following table explains the Rúmí number system in more detail, using nânakúí-jió only:


|Number|In Rúmí|Notes|
|-------|-------|-|
|0|ycö|Negative numbers are "yk-ycöm" (under 0) followed by the number| 
|1|â|-|
|2|ê|-|
|3|î|-|
|4|û|-|
|5|ô|-|
|6|íbâ| A contraction of "ô íb â"|
|7|íbê| See previous note|
|8|íbî|-|
|9|íbû|-|
|10|ânk| Derived as "one-number-up", indicates the first power of ten and therefore, 10|
|11|ânkâ|A hyphen between ânk and â is not needed|
|12|ânkê|-|
|13|ânkî|-|
|14|ânkû|-|
|15|ânkô|An optional alternative is "în-bô", literally "three hands".<br> A hyphen is recommended as "bô" is a root|
|16|ânkíbâ|-|
|17|ânkíbê|-|
|18|ânkíbî|-|
|19|ânkíbû|-|
|20|ênânk|All multiples of 10 follow the pattern of number + "n" + "ânk". <br> Examples: 30 = înânk, 80 = íbûnânk|
|21-99|ênânkâ - íbûnânkíbû| All integers from 1-99 are treated as independent roots (no hyphens) and follow the same pattern <br> Examples: 42 = ûnânkê, 57: ônânkíbê|
|100|ênk|The first 9 powers of 10 follow the pattern of "number"+"nk" <br> Examples: 1000 = înk, 1,000,000 = íbânk <br> All multiples of powers of 10 are independent roots that follow pattern of "number" + "n" + "power of 10" <br> Examples: 200 = ênênk, 800 = íbînênk|
|101-999|ênk íb â - íbûnênk íb íbûnânkíbû|All numbers > 100 are multi-word phrases that follow the pattern of "power of 10" íb "sub-100 number" <br> Examples: 404 = ûnênk íb û, 756 = íbênênk íb ônânkíbâ|
|1000-10^9|See notes|All integers keep following the above convention, with higher powers of 10 appended to the front of the phrase, followed by íb <br> Examples: 1111 = înk íb ênk íb ânkâ, 945234 = íbûnônk íb ûnûnk íb ônînk íb ênênk íb înânkû|
|10^9+|See notes|All integers greater than 10^9 are required to be written in scientific notation (see below)|

Before describing fractions, decimals and scientific notation, some basic arithmetic operations in Rúmí are presented:

## Basic Arithmetic (Nö-vú)

In each case, X and Y represent numbers. A comma is used to separate two sides of a mathematical statement to ease readability.

<ins> Addition: X + Y -> X íb Y </ins>
* Ex. 1: 5 + 10 is 15 -> Ô íb ânk, ânkó éc.
* Ex. 2: 5 + 105 is 110 -> Ô íb ênk íb ô, ênk íb ânk éc.

<ins> Subtraction: X - Y -> X yb Y </ins>
* Ex. 1: 8 - 2 is 6 -> Íbî yb ê, íbâ éc.
* Ex. 2: 120 - 13 is 107 -> Ênk íb ênânk yb ânkî, ênk íb íbê éc.

<ins> Multiplication: X * Y -> X-öm Y </ins>

NOTE: Multiplication between a number and a power of ten (scientific notation) is handled differently (see below). This section covers the multiplication of two numbers:
* Ex. 1: 8 * 8 is 64 -> Íbî-öm íbî, íbânânkû éc.
* Ex. 2: 3 * 24 is 72 -> Î-öm ênânkû, íbênânkê éc.

<ins> Division: X / Y -> Y-öd X zé *or* X ak Y yk </ins>

NOTE: The second notation is one of the 2 notations for fractions (see below)
* Ex. 1: 4 / 2 is 2 -> Ê-öd û zé, ê éc *gaf* û ak ê yk, ê éc.

## Fractions (Nöm zé)

There are two ways of denoting fractions in Rúmí. Like above, commas can be used to separate the numerator from the denominator to ease readability:

<ins> Notation #1: X/Y -> X ak Y yk </ins>
This is the same as one of the division forms (as is logical) and translates to "X above Y below". There are no restrictions to the use of this notation.
* Ex. 1: 1/2 -> Â ak ê yk.
* Ex. 2: 5/ 875 -> Ô ak, íbînênk íb íbênânkô yk.
 

<ins> Notation #2: X/Y -> X-öm Y-(ö)z </ins>
This notation can only be used if Y is a single-word number - that is, 1-99 or an integer multiple of a power of 10. On its own, the construction "Y-(ö)z" is equivalent to "<number>-th" in English.
* Ex. 1: 1/5 -> Â-öm ôz *gaf* ôz
* Ex. 2: Half -> Êz
* Ex. 3: 7/95 -> Íbê-öm íbûnânkôz
* Ex. 4: A fifty forth -> Ônânkûz
* Ex. 5: 1/10 -> Ânköz

## Decimals (Nânközö)

Writing decimals in Rúmí is straightforward and follows the same formula: (integer part) íb (â)nkozöm (decimal part). Literally, the decimal notation is the sum of the integer part and a multiple of a negative power of 10.

* Ex. 1: 1.2 -> Â íb ânközöm ê
* Ex. 2: 1.02 -> Â íb ênközöm ê
* Ex. 3: 1.002 -> Â íb înközöm ê
* Ex. 4: 23.456 -> Ênânkî íb ânközöm ûnênk íb ônânkíbâ
  * 0.456 is 0.1 * 456

## Scientific Notation (Nö-zém Nönö Jió-dú)

While scientific notation is conventionally the product of a number and a power of ten, Rúmí has a slightly different notation: (number) ab (power)(ö)m ânk-nök. "Nök" is the Rúmí translation of "exponent" and "ânk-nök" translates to "power of 10". 

* Ex. 1: 1.23 x 10^11 -> Â íb ânközöm ênânkî ab ânkâm ânk-nök.
* Ex. 2: 6.022 x 10^23 -> Íbâ íb ênközöm ênânkê ab ênânkîm ânk-nök.
  * Gaf, "Avogadró-um nö"
* Ex. 3: 6.67 x 10^-11 -> Íbâ íb ânközöm íbânânkíbê ab yk-ycöm ânkâm ânk-nök.
  * Gaf, "Yke-wúm nö"
