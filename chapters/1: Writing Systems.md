# Chapter 1: rUmI-nUI's 2 Writing Systems

rUmI is officially written in 2 ways:

## Method 1: najiO-dU

This method is mostly similar to that of aUI's in the Latin alphabet. Lowercase vowels are short in stress, uppercase are long and circumflexes (^) denote nasalization. The vowel "Ö" is always left in uppercase, and all consonants are left in lowercase (unlike in aUI). 
Hyphens separate nUIz and nI - can be used at the writer's discretion for emphasis.


**When to use:**

* When talking about rUmI's grammar
* When comparing rUmI with aUI, and when talking about nI
* When acute accents aren't available

## Method 2: Ânakúí-jió-dú

In this system, long vowels are marked using the acute accent. The circumflex still denotes nasalization. Sentence-initial letters are capitalized, and "ö" can be left in lowercase. Same as above, hyphens separate nUIz and nI and can be used at the writer's discretion for emphasis.
**This is the preferred system for writing rúmí**

**When to use**

* Whenever possible.

The remainder of chapters will use najiO-dU and ânakúí-jió-dú interchangeably. 

## Other Methods

These methods do not preclude the usage of other systems for rendering rUmI text. Any system that can distinguish nI can be used for writing rUmI.
