# 2-öm iú-ênas: Úím Nö-zé
# Chapter 2: Parts of Speech

Rúmí has 5 parts of speech: nouns (écúí), verbs (vúí), statives (cúí), prepositions (acúí) and markers (zbúí). 

## Nouns (EcUI)

Much like in toki pona, rUmI nouns describe concepts and things. Plurals are indicated by prefixing a noun with n(ö)-, with the "ö" used to increase the ease of pronunciation before a consonant at the writer's discretion.
rUmI nouns can decline into 5 cases:

* Nominative case
  * This is the default form of the noun and has no special ending. The last element of a noun in this case denotes its type ("A" for times, "E" for matter, "u" for humans, "Ö" for condition, etc)
  * If a noun doesn't need to be in any other case, its nominative form is used.
  * All objects of transitive verbs are in the nominative case.
  * Whenever using a noun with a stative, the noun must be in the nominative case.
  * Examples
    * *Fu* e-fáv (I am walking)
    * *Bu* úí-páv (You talked)
    * Kéosöf odé-páv *iods* (The bird ate the fruit)

* Ergative case: -(ö)f
  * The ergative case is used to identify *non-human* doers of actions that involve objects. Like the plural prefix, the "ö" is optional and is used to facilitate pronunciation at the writer's discretion. 
  * Human subjects (nouns ending in "u") are never marked in the ergative case.
  * Examples
    * *Kéosöf* odé-páv iods (The bird ate the fruit)
    * Um *osöf* ió-fáv yf-u (The person's pet is seeing that person)
    * *If* rúté-fáv ga (Light is improving the room)
  * Counter-example
    * Fu tytsev jió-éd (I buy a writing tool). "fu" is a human subject and is not marked in the ergative.

* Genitive/Modifier case: -(ö)m
  * The genitive case is used to indicate possession and can turn a noun into a "modifier", which functions like an adjective or adverb in English.
  * A noun in the genitive case indicates the "quality" of itself, hence the use of the "m" í.
  * Examples
    * Iú-ênas *bum* éc (The document is yours)
    * Fu ba-táv *ynânazim* e-ga (I will have a blue car)
    * *Wúm* ânawéf *nem* yrcé-páv nwé ét *ywúm* ywé (The strong rod quickly breaks stones into weak dust)

* Sociative case: -(ö)b
   * The sociative case is used to indicate that a noun is *with/beside* something else, physically.
   * The sociative is analogous to using "lon poka" in toki pona, and partially analogous to "with" in English (i.e. "going with ___", "together with", etc)
   * However, this case is **not** used to indicate that something is used for an action (such as in the English "performing {an action} *with* {an item}". This is the role of the instrumental case, discussed below.
   * Nouns in the sociative case function as modifiers with prepositional quality, and can be used similarly.
   * Examples
     * Fu *ub* e-páv (I went with him)
     * Bu *rú-osöb* ctá-fáv (You are staying with the pet)
     * *Unöb*, évu ag uga éc (The worker is inside the house with a group of people)
 
* Instrumental case: -öd
   * The instrumental case is used to indicate that a noun is *used to do something else*.
   * The instrumental is analogous to the prepositional use of "kepeken" in toki pona and analogous to "using __" in English.
   * Unlike the above cases, the "ö" is **not** optional.
   * Like with the sociative, nouns in the instrumental function as modifiers with prepositional quality.
   * Examples
     * Fu *iwéöd* tév ods (I make food using fire)
     * U *i-édöd* e-páv ad ioson (He went through the vegetation using a 'light-tool' (flashlight))
     * Fu íb fum bru *bôöd* tosfe-táv nyiods ag yg-béna (Me and my friend will handpick mushrooms in the countryside).
