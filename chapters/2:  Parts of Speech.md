# 2-öm iú-ênas: Úím Nö-zé
# Chapter 2: Parts of Speech

Rúmí has 5 parts of speech: nouns (écúí), verbs (vúí), statives (cúí), prepositions (acúí) and markers (zbúí). 

## Nouns (EcUI)

Much like in toki pona, rUmI nouns describe concepts and things. Plurals are indicated by prefixing a noun with n(ö)-, with the "ö" used to increase the ease of pronunciation before a consonant at the writer's discretion.
rUmI nouns can decline into 5 cases:

* Nominative case
  * This is the default form of the noun and has no special ending. The last element of a noun in this case denotes its type ("A" for times, "E" for matter, "u" for humans, "Ö" for condition, etc)
  * If a noun doesn't need to be in any other case, its nominative form is used.
  * All objects of transitive verbs are in the nominative case.
  * Whenever using a noun with a stative, the noun must be in the nominative case.
  * Examples
    * *Fu* e-fáv (I am walking)
    * *Bu* úí-páv (You talked)
    * Kéosöf odé-páv *iods* (The bird ate the fruit)

* Ergative case: -(ö)f
  * The ergative case is used to identify *non-human* doers of actions that involve objects. Like the plural prefix, the "ö" is optional and is used to facilitate pronunciation at the writer's discretion. 
  * Human subjects (nouns ending in "u") are never marked in the ergative case.
  * Examples
    * *Kéosöf* odé-páv iods (The bird ate the fruit)
    * Um *osöf* ió-fáv yf-u (The person's pet is seeing that person)
    * *If* rúté-fáv ga (Light is improving the room)
  * Counter-example
    * Fu tytsev jió-éd (I buy a writing tool). "fu" is a human subject and is not marked in the ergative.

* Genitive/Modifier case: -(ö)m
  * The genitive case is used to indicate possession and can turn a noun into a "modifier", which functions like an adjective or adverb in English.
  * A noun in the genitive case indicates the "quality" of itself, hence the use of the "m" í.
  * Examples
    * Iú-ênas *bum* éc (The document is yours)
    * Fu ba-táv *ynânazim* e-ga (I will have a blue car)
    * *Wúm* ânawéf *nem* yrcé-páv nwé ét *ywúm* ywé (The strong rod quickly breaks stones into weak dust)

* Sociative case: -(ö)b
   * The sociative case is used to indicate that a noun is *with/beside* something else, physically.
   * The sociative is analogous to using "lon poka" in toki pona, and partially analogous to "with" in English (i.e. "going with ___", "together with", etc)
   * However, this case is **not** used to indicate that something is used for an action (such as in the English "performing {an action} *with* {an item}". This is the role of the instrumental case, discussed below.
   * Nouns in the sociative case function as modifiers with prepositional quality, and can be used similarly.
   * Examples
     * Fu *ub* e-páv (I went with him)
     * Bu *rú-osöb* ctá-fáv (You are staying with the pet)
     * *Unöb*, évu ag uga éc (The worker is inside the house with a group of people)
 
* Instrumental case: -öd
   * The instrumental case is used to indicate that a noun is *used to do something else*.
   * The instrumental is analogous to the prepositional use of "kepeken" in toki pona and analogous to "using __" in English.
   * Unlike the above cases, the "ö" is **not** optional.
   * Like with the sociative, nouns in the instrumental function as modifiers with prepositional quality.
   * Examples
     * Fu *iwéöd* tév ods (I make food using fire)
     * U *i-édöd* e-páv ad ioson (He went through the vegetation using a 'light-tool' (flashlight))
     * Fu íb fum bru *bôöd* tosfe-táv nyiods ag yg-béna (Me and my friend will handpick mushrooms in the countryside).
    
 ## Verbs (vUI)

rUmI verbs are conjugated to reflect tense, conditionality and commands/desires. All rUmI verbs end with the "-v" element, which is substituted with a new ending (conjugation) for each tense/aspect. All verbs conjugate the same way regardless of person and rUmI has no irregular verbs.

|Tense/Aspect|Ending|Use|Example(s)|Notes|
|-------|-------|---|-------------|-|
|Infinitive/Present Tense|-v|Actions in the present, also as gerunds|Fu sev fé (I give this), sev (to give/send)|-|
|Present Continuous Tense|-fAv|"I am ___ ing", actions in progress|Bu se-fáv yfé (You are giving that)|-|
|Past Tense|-pAv|Actions in the past|U se-páv iú-ênas (She gave the document)|rUmI does not have perfect tenses, so this sentence could also mean "She had sent the document"| 
|Future Tense|-tAv|Actions in the future|Fnu nám se-táv núís (We will send the essay late)|This sentence can also mean "We will have sent the essay late".|
|Conditional Aspect|-Öv|Actions with a possibility of occurrence ("may/might")|Fu se-öv fé (I might give this)|-|
|Imperative Aspect|-vte|Commands, wish that an action takes place (same as "o" in toki pona)| Se-vte tytsevs (Give money), Bu se-vte tytsevs (You should give money)|-|

Note that **with the exception of the imperative aspect**, these are the same conjugations as in aUI. Also unlike aUI, rUmI does not have a dedicated conjugation for passive voice. Some notes regarding passive constructions:
* Passive voice **is forbidden** when the subject is human (ending in "-u").
  * "The fruit is eaten by her" is not allowed and must be rephrased as "U odév iods" (She eats the fruit).
  * A recurring theme in rUmI is the **centrality of human subjects**.
* Passive voice **is allowed** with non-human subjects (unlike in toki pona) and can be realized by switching the positions of the ergative-marked subject and object.
  * Kéosöf odé-fáv ynaos -> active voice, "the bird is eating the insect"
  * Ynaos odé-fáv kéosöf -> passive voice, "the insect is being eaten by the bird"
* In general, the active voice is preferred.

rUmI verbs can optionally take on a **inchoative aspect** to indicate that an action has begun/is heading toward a a result. This can be achieved by appending "t-" to the verb stem. Some examples:
* ev (to move) vs. tev (to begin to move)
* sev (to send) vs. tsev (to strive to send)
* âv (to unite) vs. tâv (to begin to unite)

Some verbs are inchoative by default and do not need to be further marked. These include:
* ctáv (to remain)
* túv (to strive toward). In fact, all inchoative constuctions can be replaced by "túv ___":
   * tsev and túv sev are the same



 ## Statives (cUI)

Statives are a part of speech unique to rUmI. They are used to describe existences, similar to the verb "is" in English or "lon" in toki pona. They function similar to nouns and verbs though importantly, statives **do not follow noun and verb declination and conjugation rules**. All statives end with the element "-c". They can be divided into three categories - base, inchoative and synthetic statives.

Note: Statives do not describe temporary or reversible states (i.e. motion, feelings). Those can be described using the "-Ö" suffix to denote conditions.

<ins> Base statives </ins>

There are four base statives - Ec, Uc, Öc and yc. "Ec", "Uc" and "Öc" can be translated variously to "is", "existing", "true" or "yes", and "yc" to "isn't", "not existing" or "false". However, each base stative has a different use case:

|Base Stative|Closer Translation|Use|Example(s)|Notes|
|-------|-------|---|-------------|-|
|Ec|"physically exists"|To indicate that something exists, is at some place or is generally of some quality|Wé éc (A rock exists),<br> Wé ab béna éc (The rock is on the ground),<br> Wé wém éc (The rock is tough)|This is the most common stative and can be used in place of Uc as well. Is also used to say "yes"|
|Uc|"conceptually exists"|To indicate that something exists as a concept or ideal, is true or correct|Nu úg, iods rú úc (To humans, food is good), <br> Fé úc (This is true)|-|
|Öc|"conditionally exists"|To indicate that something might exist|Ad ké evöm döcúb nö-jéos öc (Fish with the ability of movement through air may exist)|-|
|yc|"Not exist"|To indicate that something isn't|Jéos u yc (A fish isn't a human), <br> Fú íb bú ag búö yc (You and I aren't in agreement)|Is also used to say "no"|

<ins> Inchoative statives </ins>

There are 2 inchoative statives - tEc and tyc, defined as "to become" and "to disappear". Like inchoative verbs, they are used to indicate states of existence that are about to begin/in progress.
* Fú nám téc (I am becoming older)
* Um rú tyc (His goodness is disappearing)

<ins> Synthetic statives </ins>

Synthetic statives are used to describe permanent, enduring or absolute qualities and can be created from any root or nI-combination. There are two general uses for synthetic statives:
* Case 1: Permanent states.
  * There are a few cases where a synthetic stative is preferred over a modifier, the most common being to tell is something is broken (yrc). Ex. "Éd yrc" (The tool is broken). Note that "Éd yrcöm éc" would be used if the tool was temporarily broken.
  * Another case is the "is forever _____ " construct. Ex. "Ak ké u wúc" (The person above the sky is forever strong) or "Iúm ná-ios nac" (The tree of knowledge is forever tall)
* Case 2: Absolute comparisons.
  * This is the most common use for a synthetic stative and is always used in comparative clauses. Ex. Fum brú úx, fu nac (Relative to my friend, I am the tallest), "Canöm nu úx, fum ytu ic" (Relative to everyone, my father is the brightest).

## Prepositions (acUI)

rUmI prepositions contain "a" or "A" in their non-negative forms.

|Preposition|Meaning|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|ab|"at"|-|
|yb|"not at, without"|-|
|ap|"in front"|-|
|yp|"behind"|Can also mean "end"|
|at|"toward"|-|
|yt|"away, from"|-|
|ak|"above, on top"|-|
|yk|"below"|-|
|ag|"inside"|-|
|yg|"outer"|-|
|ad|"through"|-|
|yd|"against"|-|
|fA|"now"|Marks the present|
|pA|"Before, past"|Marks the past|
|tA|"Future"|Marks the future|


Prepositions can be used in two ways:
* Case 1: As traditional prepositions
  * Prepositions placed after a subject and before something (a noun, clause or modifier) indicate a subject's spatial or temporal relationship with the thing
  * Ex. 1: Fu *ab* yru-ga (I am at the hospital)
  * Ex. 2: Bu *ap* u ág, u e-páv *yt* bu (When you were in front of her, she moved away from you)

* Case 2: To mark a prepositional clause
  * A clause is a phrase that acts as a modifier. Prepositional clauses are defined by placing the preposition *after* a word or group of words.
  * Ex. 1: Yru-ga *ab*, fu éc (At the hospital, I am). Note: can also be rephrased to ex.1 above.
  * Ex. 2: *Tá*, fnu e-táv (In the future, we will go).
  * Ex. 3: U odév *ap*, fu éc (In front of the person who eats, I am) -> (I am in front of the person who is eating)

 Note that nouns in the sociative case can function as prepositions. It is best practice to limit the size of prepositional phrases to the shortest possible form, in order to ease readability.
