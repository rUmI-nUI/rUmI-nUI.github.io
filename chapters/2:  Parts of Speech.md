# 2-öm iú-ênas: ÚÍm Nö-zém
# Chapter 2: Parts of Speech

Rúmí has 5 parts of speech: nouns (écúí), verbs (vúí), statives (cúí), prepositions (acúí) and markers (zbúí). 

## Nouns (EcUI)

Much like in toki pona, rUmI nouns describe concepts and things. Plurals are indicated by prefixing a noun with n(ö)-, with the "ö" used to increase the ease of pronunciation before a consonant at the writer's discretion.
rUmI nouns can decline into 5 cases:

* Nominative case
  * This is the default form of the noun and has no special ending. The last element of a noun in this case denotes its type ("A" for times, "E" for matter, "u" for humans, "Ö" for condition, etc)
  * If a noun doesn't need to be in any other case, its nominative form is used.
  * All objects of transitive verbs are in the nominative case.
  * Examples
    * *Fu* e-fáv (I am walking)
    * *Bu* úí-páv (You talked)
    * Kéosöf odé-páv *iods* (The bird ate the fruit)

* Ergative case: -(ö)f
  * The ergative case is used to identify *non-human* doers of actions that involve objects. Like the plural prefix, the "ö" is optional and is used to facilitate pronunciation at the writer's discretion. 
  * Human subjects (nouns ending in "u") are never marked in the ergative case
  * Examples
    * *Kéosöf* odgu-páv iods (The bird ate the fruit)
    * Um *osöf* ió-fáv yf-u (The person's pet sees that person)
    * *If* rúté-fáv ga (Light improves the room)
