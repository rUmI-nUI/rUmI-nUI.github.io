# aUI Elements

At its heart, rUmI *is* aUI and therefore, aUI elements are integral to constructing words. We can organize these elements into 2 categories:

## Group 1: Basic Types

|Element|Meaning|Notes|
|-------|-------|-------------|
|a|Space, place, location|-|
|A|Time|In rUmI, can also be spelled as "á"|
|e|Movement, motion|Also, "flow"|
|v|Action, to make, verb marker|-|
|i|Light, knowledge|-|
|I|Sound|Can also be spelled as "í"|
|U|Spirit, mind, abstract concept|Can also be spelled as "ú"|
|u|Human, person|-|
|O|Feeling, sensation|Can also be spelled as "ó"|
|o|Life|-|
|c|Existence, being|-|
|s|Thing, concrete concept|Contrasts with "U"|
|E|Matter, material, tangible|Can also be spelled as "é"|
|w|Power, force|-|

## Group 2: Qualifiers

|Element|Meaning|Notes|
|-------|-------|-------------|
|n|Quantity, much/many, amount, plural, number|-|
|â, ê, î, ô|1, 2, 3, 5|Additional number elements exist, though these three are the most important*|
|m|Quality, kind, adjective marker|-|
|r|Positive, good|-|
|j|Equal, same, even|-|
|L|Rounded|-|
|z|Part, portion, division|-|
|b|Together, proximity|-|
|f|This, present|-|
|t|Toward, to, future|-|
|p|Before, previous, in front|2 distinct usages: "forward-ness" and as a marker of the past|
|d|Through, as means of, tool|-|
|g|Inside, within, holding|-|
|k|Above, up, high|-|
|Q, Ö|Condition, conditional-if, state|Recommended to use Ö, "Q" as recommended in aUI does not make much sense as a vowel|
|x|Relation|Also, "related"|
|h|Question marker|-|
|y|Negation and opposite|2 distinct and common usages, more on this later|


* A full list of aUI number elements from 0-10: ŷ, â, ê, î, û, ô, Â, Ê, Î, Û, Ô.


Unlike toki pona, rUmI also endorses an element for "3". However, as one of the objectives of rUmI is to allow the coexistence of general and specific expression,
 the usage of the other number markers is *not* discouraged.
