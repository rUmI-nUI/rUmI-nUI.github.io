# aUI Elements
rUmI words and stems are constructed from the aUI elements of meaning. We can organize these elements into 2 categories:

## Group 1: Basic Types

|Element|Pronunciation (IPA)|Meaning|Notes|
|-------|-------|---|-------------|
|a|a~ʌ|Space, place, location|-|
|A|a:|Time|In rUmI, can also be spelled as "á"|
|e|e|Movement, motion|Also, "flow"|
|v|v|Action, to make, verb marker|-|
|i|i|Light, knowledge|-|
|I|i:|Sound|Can also be spelled as "í"|

## Group 2: Qualifiers

|-------|----|-------|-------------|
|n|n|Quantity, much/many, amount, plural, number|-|
|â, ê, î, ô|ã:, ẽ:, ĩ:, õ:|1, 2, 3, 5|Additional number elements exist, though these three are the most important*|

|f|f|This, present|-|
|t|t|Toward, to, future|-|
|p|p|Before, previous, in front|2 distinct usages: "forward-ness" and as a marker of the past|
|d|d|Through, as means of, tool|-|
|g|g|Inside, within, holding|-|
|k|k|Above, up, high|-|
|Q, Ö|œ|Condition, conditional-if, state|Recommended to use Ö, "Q" as recommended in aUI does not make much sense as a vowel|
|x|x|Relation|Also, "related"|
|h|h|Question marker|-|
|y|y~yj|Negation and opposite|2 distinct and common usages, more on this later|


* A full list of aUI number elements from 0-10: ŷ, â, ê, î, û, ô, Â, Ê, Î, Û, Ô.

The circumflex (^) denotes nasalization of the vowel. Nasal consonants following these vowels are geminated in pronunciation (Ex: "ãn" sounds like "uhnn")


Unlike toki pona, rUmI also endorses an element for "3". However, as one of the objectives of rUmI is to allow the coexistence of general and specific expression,
 the usage of the other number markers is *not* discouraged.
