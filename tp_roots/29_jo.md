# nimi #29: *jo*
# Root: *-bav-*
Derivation: -together-space-action-

Note: rUmI (and base aUI) uses "ba" as a preposition to mean "at". More on this later.

## Form 1: To have/hold/contain
### bav (verb): (together-space-action)
* In base aUI: gav for "contain".

## Form 2: Possession
### bavÖ (noun): (together-space-action-condition)
* In base aUI: bavs. The conditional element "Ö" makes more sense, since possession can be reversible.
