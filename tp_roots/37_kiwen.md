# nimi #37: *kiwen*
# Root: *-wE-*
Derivation: -strong-matter-

## Form 1: Stone, hard material, tough
### wE(m) (noun, adj.): (strong-matter-(quality))

## Form 2: Metal
### ew-wE (noun): (movement-power-strong-matter)
* In base aUI: rE, from the observation that metals are electropositive. This isn't always the case, though, and there are electronegative metals (most famously, gold). However, all metals are by definition conductors or give rise to conducting materials themselves, so the root "ew" makes sense in a power transmission/conductance context.
