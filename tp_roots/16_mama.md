# nimi #16: *mama*

## Form 1: Parent
### ytu (noun): (not-toward-human)
* In base aUI: ytvu and ytmu for male and female parent respectively. Denoting gender is unnecessarily inflexible and should be avoided in rUmI (as in toki pona).
### ytum (adj.): "Parental" (not-toward-human-quality)

## Form 2: Origin
### ytU (noun): (not-toward-spirit)
* "yta" might also work here, though -U- may fit better as an abstract concept.

## Form 3: Ancestor
### pA-ytu (noun): (before-time-not-toward-human)
* In base aUI: Ap-ytytu
