## Form 1: To give/send/emit
### sev (verb): (thing-toward-action)
* In base aUI: "Giving", "sending" and "emitting" are handled as separate concepts (fYt-sev, svav, tYg-vev, respectively). As a core philosophy of rUmI is to allow for simplicity in expression, we treat these concepts as the same. For added granularity, extra descriptors can be affixed:
  * ta-sev (verb): "To send toward (i.e. send)" (toward-space thing-toward-action)
  * tu-sev (verb): "To send toward a person (i.e. give)" (toward-human thing-toward-action)
  * E-sev (verb): "To send matter (i.e. emit)" (matter thing-toward-action)
