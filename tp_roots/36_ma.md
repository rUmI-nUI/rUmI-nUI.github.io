# Root: *-bEna-*
Derivation: -together-matter-many-space-

## Form 1: Land, country
### bEna (noun): (together-matter-many-space)
* In base aUI: "una" for country. This seems more fitting for "convention" instead of the country/land connotation of "ma". A better rUmI version could be "jun-bEna" (same-people-many-), since all people in an ideal country are united.

## Form 2: Outdoors
### yg-bEna (noun): (not-inside-together-matter-many-space)
* In base aUI: yga
