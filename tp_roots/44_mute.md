# nimi #44: *mute*
# Root: *-nEm-* or *-n(Ö)-* (to mark plurals)
Derivation: -plural-matter-quality-, -plural-condition-

## Form 1: Much/many/a lot
### nEm (adj.): (plural-matter-quality)
* In base aUI: nEn

## Form 2: Quantity
### nEmU (noun): (plural-matter-quality-spirit)
* In base aUI: nU. More apt for "concepts/topics"

## As a plural marker:
### Marking plurals in rUmI is achieved by appending "n-" or "nÖ-" in front of a word. Some examples:
* iOs (eye), niOs (eyes)
* iods (fruit), niods (fruits)
* ga (room), nÖ-ga (rooms)
  * The "n-" vs "nÖ-" choice is based on ease of pronunciation and is entirely flexible in rUmI (unlike base aUI's mandatory requirement of anglophone-influenced pronuncibility for words). Depending on the writer's mother tongue, "nga" may be a valid combination of sounds and is thus permissible.
* jEos (fish), nÖ-jEos (fish)
* vIu (human maker of sound), "nÖ-vIu (human makers of sound)
