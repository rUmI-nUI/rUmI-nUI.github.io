# nimi #32: *pipi*
# Root: *-yna-()-o-*
Derivation: -not-much-space-(other elements)-life-

## Form 1: Bug/Insect
### ynaos (noun): (not-much-space-life-thing)
* In base aUI: Ã®zos for "insect", derived from "3 part thing". This may be true for arthropods, but "pipi" as a toki pona word is intended to offer a catch-all term for all small living things (insects, bugs, spiders, germs, etc)

## Form 2: Germ 
### ynagos (noun): (not-much-space-inside-life-thing)
* In base aUI: vyroz. Seems like a contrived attempt to sound like "virus". 
* Suggested use of this term is when additional specificity is needed. "ynaos" works in most cases, just like how "pipi" is used in toki pona.
