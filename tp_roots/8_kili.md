# nimi #8: *kili*
# Root: *-iod-* or *-yiod-* (mushroom)
Derivation: -(no)-light-life-means-

## Form 1: Fruit, vegetable
### iods (noun): (light-life-means-thing)
* In base aUI: iod (vegetable), ot (fruit)
  * Note: Another instance of a longer rUmI root vs. base aUI. Vegetables and fruits serve functions for plants (energy storage, seed dispersal, etc) but are fundamentally "things". The base aUI "ot" (life-toward) makes more sense as a word for "seed", but looks more like a preposition (-t- ending).
 
## Form 2: Mushroom, fungus
### yiods (noun): (no-light-life-means-thing)
* In base aUI: yios
  * Again, mushrooms and (visible parts of) fungi are reproductive structures of the actual fungi/mycelia. This requires the -d- and -s- elements to be scientifically accurate.
